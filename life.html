            Matthew Mercer was born Matthew Cristopher Miller im Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, on June 29, 1982. 
            When he was young, he spoke with a stutter; his father, who shared this, got him a speech therapist who helped him reduce it so that only certain words would trigger it.
            When he got into voice acting, he took the name "Mercer" because his birth name was too similar to someone already represented by the actor's union SAG-AFTRA.
